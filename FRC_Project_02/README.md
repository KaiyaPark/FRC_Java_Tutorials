# FRC Project 02 #
In this project, you are going to select a partner to be able to work with, and both of you will be creating algorithm that does the following:
* When you initially run the robot code, the robot must initially move forward. But when you press a given button on the joystick, it must move backward. And when the button is pressed again, it should go back front, and so on and so forth.
