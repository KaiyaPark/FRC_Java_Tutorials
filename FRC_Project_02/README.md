# FRC Project 02 #
In this project, you are going to select a partner to be able to work with, and both of you will be creating an algorithm that does the following:
* The robot must be able to drive forward straightly at ```0.3``` speed for a given distance. For example, you can create a method called ```public void goStraight(double distance)``` where the function makes the robot go straight until the encoder values for both the sides have reached the value of ```distance```.

## Encoders ##
For the purpose of this project, encoders are sensors that measure how much degrees a motor has been rotated. So for example,
