# Potential OffSeason Stuff

## Java Book ##
If you would like to review/learn java, here is a helpful [book](https://github.com/MillenniumFalcons/FRC_Java_Tutorials/blob/master/OffSeason%20Stuff%20Maybe/JavaBook.pdf).

## FRC Java ##
If you would like to learn about programming the robot, please start working on [FRC Projects](https://github.com/MillenniumFalcons/FRC_Java_Tutorials).

## Vision ##
Our team has a jevois camera. Here is the [documentation]() for using it in the FRC environment.
* I believe that Kunal started working on it with GRIP. If you have any questions please ask him or Darren on slack.

## Other Stuff ##
* For practicing purposes, you can program the elevator or other mechanisms for the 2017/2018 Robot.
* You could perhaps figure out how to use [ChezyPath](https://github.com/Team254/FRC-2017-Public/tree/master/cheesy_path) or [Jaci's PathFinder](https://github.com/JacisNonsense/Pathfinder). Motion Profiling is fun.
* If we build an arm bot, have Farrah program it.
* Program autonomous paths for offseason competitions. (Make them time based?)
* Also our current elevator program isn't the best. Feel free to make it better.
