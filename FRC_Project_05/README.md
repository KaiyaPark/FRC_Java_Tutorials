# FRC Project 05 #
In this project, you are going to select a partner to be able to work with, and both of you will be creating  an algorithm that does the following:
* You will program 3 autonomous functions that will make the robot move in certain paths. In this specific exercise, you will be programming an autonomous for the 2017 competition.

## Goal of the Project ##
You will program 3 autonomous functions that do the following:
1. The Robot will move forward a bit.
2. The robot will turn so that it aligns properly to the peg to deliver the gear.
3. The robot should return to the starting position.

In the case of programming the middle autonomous, you wouldn't need to turn. Here are some example paths:
* Middle Auto:
