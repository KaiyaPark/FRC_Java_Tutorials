## Setting up java on your laptop ##
In order to program in Java on your laptop, we need to install the necessary files and software before we actually start programming. In order to run and edit java files, we need a java compiler. We are going to install Eclipse. Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming and is the most widely used Java IDE. It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment.

For setting up java on eclipse:
* If you have Windows, please click [here](https://youtu.be/wf6Qp-ecsog)
* If you have a Mac:
  * 1st Click [here](https://youtu.be/y6szNJ4rMZ0) for instructions on how to install the Java JDK
  * 2nd Click [here](https://youtu.be/gufMbpxzfWw) for instructions on how to setup java on eclipse

## Installing the FRC Environment onto Eclipse ##
* To program for the robot, you have to install a different environment provided by FRC. Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/80QNfripEOI?t=306) on how to install the FRC plugins for eclipse.
* Note: If you have already installed eclipse and the Java JDK's like you should have, please skip the video to the 5:06 mark.
